## Overview

![screenshot](screen.jpg)

- Click [here](https://gastonpedraza08.github.io/image-uploader/) to see a demo!
- This challenge was magnificent, and it is very practical to know the basics of how browsers work.
- With this challenge I have learned to create an API with Nodejs to store images on the server side. I have also learned the concepts of compatibility with browsers, handle drag and drop event and the handling of the clipboard (function to copy texts to the clipboard).
